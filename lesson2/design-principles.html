        This clearly shows the use of an obvious grid layout, if not a bit simple.
        The website, in this viewpoint, isn't too eyecatching, but clearly the design
        leads the user down the screen. While simplictic, it get the job done.

        This is website that creates PC's for anyone who wants one,
        it's as simple as choosing a pre-built pc or picking the parts
        yourself. The spacing around objects gives a simple, yet classy feeling to the user.
        This design philsophy comes from how all the fonts are spaced, nothing is too close, creating
        the feeling of complexity.

    I believe Netlfix reflects the order of importance very well. Size,
    color, and contrast are all at use here, and that reflects how users
    operate the site as well. Because they used this design principle, you
    focus in what they're selling, the content they're offering, which only
    inlfuences the user.
